## üõ† Problems Napnad Solves

In today's fast-paced world, sleep deprivation has become a widespread issue, negatively impacting productivity, mental health, and overall quality of life. Traditional sleep-tracking apps often fail to motivate users to improve their sleep habits, and many compromise user privacy by collecting and sharing sensitive health data.

Napnad addresses these challenges by:

Gamifying sleep improvement through token rewards.

Ensuring data privacy using zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS) to verify sleep data without exposing raw metrics.

Providing AI-powered sleep coaching to offer personalized recommendations and insights.
