Sleep2Earn is a Web3-based application designed to tackle the growing issue of sleep deprivation in modern society. By incentivizing better sleep habits, Sleep2Earn aims to improve productivity, mental health, and overall well-being. Users are rewarded with tokens for meeting predefined sleep goals, all while ensuring their sensitive health data remains private and secure.

## Problem Solved
In today's fast-paced world, sleep deprivation has become a widespread issue, negatively impacting productivity, mental health, and overall quality of life. Traditional sleep-tracking apps often fail to motivate users to improve their sleep habits, and many compromise user privacy by collecting and sharing sensitive health data.

Sleep2Earn addresses these challenges by:
- **Gamifying sleep improvement** through token rewards.
- **Ensuring data privacy** using zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS) to verify sleep data without exposing raw metrics.

---

## Solution Offered
Sleep2Earn connects users' sleep-tracking devices (e.g., smartwatches) to the app. Using zkTLS, the app verifies the authenticity of sleep data (e.g., duration, quality) without exposing sensitive information. Users are rewarded with tokens for meeting their sleep goals, which can be redeemed for discounts, gift cards, or other perks.

### Key Features:
- **Privacy-First Approach**: Sleep data is verified using zkTLS, ensuring user privacy.
- **Token Rewards**: Earn tokens for achieving sleep goals.
- **Gamification**: Stay motivated with a gamified experience.
- **Web3 Integration**: Built on blockchain for transparency and security.

## How It Works
1. **Connect Your Device**: Link your sleep-tracking device (e.g., smartwatch) to the Sleep2Earn app.
2. **Set Sleep Goals**: Define your sleep duration and quality targets.
3. **Earn Tokens**: Receive tokens for meeting your sleep goals, verified securely using zkTLS.
4. **Redeem Rewards**: Use your tokens for discounts, gift cards, or other perks.
