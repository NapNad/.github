## Description
Sleep2Earn is a Web3-based application designed to tackle the growing issue of sleep deprivation in modern society. By incentivizing better sleep habits, Sleep2Earn aims to improve productivity, mental health, and overall well-being. Users are rewarded with tokens for meeting predefined sleep goals, all while ensuring their sensitive health data remains private and secure.

## üõ† Problems Sleep2Earn Solves
In today's fast-paced world, sleep deprivation has become a widespread issue, negatively impacting productivity, mental health, and overall quality of life. Traditional sleep-tracking apps often fail to motivate users to improve their sleep habits, and many compromise user privacy by collecting and sharing sensitive health data.

Sleep2Earn addresses these challenges by:
- **Gamifying sleep improvement** through token rewards.
- **Ensuring data privacy** using zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS) to verify sleep data without exposing raw metrics.
